# DJ with Arduino

> This is a simple program to test MIDI protocol with Arduino. What was used:
> Hardware:
- _Arduino board_
- _3x buttons_
- _3x 10k resistors_
- _Protoboard_
> Software:
- _Hairless-MIDI serial_
- _LoopBe1_
- _Mixxx - Free DJ Mixing_
- _IDE Arduino_

### Hairless-MIDI serial
Hairless MIDI<->Serial Bridge is the easiest way to connect serial devices (like Arduinos) to send and receive MIDI signals.
### LoopBe1
LoopBe1 is an internal MIDI device for transferring MIDI data between computer programs. Basically LoopBe1 is an "invisible cable" to connect a MIDI outport of an application to any other application´s MIDI inport.
All MIDI data sent to the program´s output is channeled to the receiving applications in realtime.
### Mixxx - Free DJ Mixing
Mixxx is free open-source software and entirely community-driven.
